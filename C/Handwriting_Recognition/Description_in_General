All assignments in CSCB09 in 2021 will center around implementing solutions to image recognition problems, an important class of machine learning problems. 
The specific problem that we will focus on in our assignments is handwriting recognition.
More specifically, we developed programs that can read in images of hand-written digits and automaticallydetermine which digit the image shows.


Generally speaking, the goal of the machine learning algorithm is to use a set of sample images that are already correctly labelled (called the training set) 
and try to extract knowledge from it that it can use to later label new images (called the test set) that it has not yet seen. 
In machine learning lingo, this is called a classification problem : we are trying toassign an input item (an image in our case) to one of ten classes 
(corresponding to the digits 1 to 10)based on features of the input items (the pixels of each image make up its key features).
