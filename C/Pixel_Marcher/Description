Given some images, the marcher's mission is to walk from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner.
Every step it takes costs some energy (which is determined by a weight function that is provided for the assignment). 
The Pixel Marcher wants to find the path that takes up the least energy.
The weight function that is provided is the key element that decides this least-energy path.

Weight function (1) reflects how similar the pixel is to its neighbour, and weight function (2) reflects 
how close the neighboring pixel is to white. Both of these weight functions are provided as part of the 
starter code in the test marcher.c and driver.c files.
